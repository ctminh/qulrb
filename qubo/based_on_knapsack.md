# QUBO FORMULATION

"Given a possibly suboptimal assignemnt of jobs to processors, reassign jobs to different processors so as to minimize the makespan, by moving as few jobs as possible. More specifically, we look at the problem of minimizing the makespan, while migrating no more than $k$ jobs." [SPAA-03]

$N$ - number of tasks

$M$ - number of processes

$t_j$ - time of the execution of task $j$ (does not depend on the process)


$$ \begin{equation}
         x_{i,j}= 
\begin{cases}
    1,  & \text{task } j \text{ is assigned to processor } i,\\
    0,              & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
 \end{equation}$$

### Objective function 

min $\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} (avg - \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} t_j \cdot x_{i,j})^2 $, where $ avg = \frac{\sum_{j} t_j}{N}$

The closer the objective function to 0, the better the more equally distributed the tasks.


### Constraints
- Migrate no more than $k$ jobs

$ \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} (1 - \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} (\hat{x}_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j})^2) \leq k$, where $\hat{x}_{i,j}$ is the original assignment

- The assignment cannot be worse than the original one

$ \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} t_j \cdot x_{i,j} \leq c \text{, } \forall_{i} \in {0, \dots, M-1} $, where $c$ is the makespan

- Each task has to be assigned to exactly one processor (it depends on the encoding of the problem)
 
 $ \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} x_{i,j} = 1 \forall_{j} \in {0, \dots, N-1}$
